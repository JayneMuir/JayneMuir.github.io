I am a software engineer living in the Greater San Diego area. I am originally from Florence, Alabama. I moved to San Diego to get my Masters degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. Of course, I have not left.

I was in need of some updated skills. For many years I programmed using Visual C++. I used Design Patterns and the Agile Methodology for projects I worked on. One thing that I lacked was experience in front end web development. So I signed up for the Bloc Frontend Web Development Boot Camp and here I am making my portfolio.
